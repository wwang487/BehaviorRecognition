## Installation
1. The pretrained model is placed in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EOmhEn5Ry-97LNm5e3ewrZYmgzALvHCx?usp=sharing
Please download them and copy them to data/pretrained_model for both species and behavior models.

2. The model is built and tested in Ubuntu 20.04, with Cuda 11.1, python 3.8, and pyTorch 1.9.1, the other required Python packages specified in requirement.txt. Open terminal in BehaviorRecognition/, type **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install all the required packages.

3. Open terminal in BehaviorRecognition/SpeModel/lib, type **python setup.py build develop** in the terminal to set up the required environment.

## Training

### Data Preparation

### Code Moficiation

1. Adjust labels for species and behaviors: open **SpeModel/lib/datasets/pascal_voc.py** and **BehaviorModel/lib/datasets/pascal_voc.py**, change **self.class** to match your case. 

## Testing

## Acknowledgement

The basic Faster R-CNN model without two-step settings is built by jwyang under the following link:

https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/tree/pytorch-1.0

Our model uses their work as the starting point, and refined their model to a two-step animal behavior recognition model, which first identify animal species, then identify animal behavior patterns.
